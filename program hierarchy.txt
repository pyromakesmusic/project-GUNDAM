Define the problem:

I want to build a suit of power armor that will help me protect people.

Define your tools, targets, and backup plan:

Target users:

Me. I want a focus on redundancy, light weight, mobility, and communications.

Target architecture:

Microcontroller connected to a mini computer running the most stable OS for the 
application I can find.

Tools:

Code::Blocks
Arduino

Alone or with a team:

Alone for now

Requirements:

 Mobility
  Actuators must move in response to EMG + MMG signal, accurately.
   A microcontroller must receive input from EMG and MMG sensors and put it into arrays.
   A computer must apply machine-learned curves to those arrays to convert them into
   output information for the actuators.
    A machine-learning algorithm must have an established dataset from which to construct
    a curve.
   The signal must be smooth and free from errors.
 Security
  Architecture must be invulnerable to penetration attempts.
 Communications
  Must be WiFi-capable.
  Must be Bluetooth-equipped.
  Must be able to sweep large bands of the radio signal spectrum.

Testing strategy:

Feedback strategy:

Release strategy:

Backup plan:

I will backup my code securely at least once every day.
